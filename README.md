# Py-Wpg
Platform for assembly, annotation and visualization of bacterial genomes

Exercise 1: A python (or biopython) script to query NCBI to download E coli contigs in fasta format.
Three arguments need to be specified for running the script: your valid email address, your NCBI api key and number of assemblies you want to download.
If you dont have an NCBI api key, create an account at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/ using your email. Once you sign in, go to the top right corner where your email id displayed. Click on it and you will be directed to a new page where you can find your api key. Copy the key to use it as an argument for the script. 

Usage: python fetch_contigs.py "Valid email id" "NCBI api_key" "number of assemblies"
